I got a text yesterday from out of the blue:

> Hope the head cleared. Would u text me jackies no – wiped if off phone. Thks. Nb fullstops – no aps though!

The sender’s number was given, although unknown to my address book. I was in the process of replying to the unknown sender, thinking,

> wrong number – decent thing is to let them know they’re mistaken,

when I started pondering the last sentence. It made no sense to me. It made me think it might be a machine sending emails to random mobile numbers in an attempt to harvest active mobile users, like those random text messages I have been receiving about compensation for the “accident I had recently”. So I didnt reply, and if it was your text, sorry about that, but there was a risk in replying (it can cost money to receive texts and people I know have lost all of their credit through similar scams) and some doubt put me right off.
