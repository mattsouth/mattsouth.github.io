The nice people at Guardian media gave me a crash course in Agile methods last week (thanks guys). Since then I’ve been doing some research. Find enclosed some potentially useful links..

code katas

software retreats

“codo dojos”

<div><div>*The major issue is a lack of experience of working with agile/extreme programming techniques. He lacked experience working with TDD or feature-based development. While he was good at collaborating and working together it seems to us that a lot of his work has been outside a commercial large team environment and therefore there is current a gap between his experience and what we would need in the Guardian.*</div><div> </div><div>*We recognise that Matthew’s skills are definitely above average but we currently have a lot of specific requirements that he hasn’t yet met in his career.*</div></div><div> </div><div>*We’d welcome Matthew to reapply in the future if he gained more experience in a comparable environment to the Guardian or spent some time working on software craftmanship (<http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/>). He might find it valuable to look into things like codo dojos or software retreats.*</div>
