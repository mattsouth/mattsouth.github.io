Two classes of users

For a CMS there are two classes of user:

 1. the content generator.  
 2. the site manager.

For our Drupal sites, the user experience for the first class of users, the content generators, has been disappointing. As I understand it, the main issues are:

 \* too complex a mental model for administration functionality  
 \* no wysiwig editor  
 \* poor image support  
 \* not enough flexibility in the page structure

Please let me know if you have any other gripes.

For the second class of user I’ve found Drupal to be productive. The main classes of tasks for site managers are:

 \* Get a new site up and running  
 \* Apply functionality and security updates  
 \* Add new functionality

I chose drupal because it was actively maintained and being used by a lot of different organisations. The size of it’s user and developer base adds very strongly to the last two points. I found it reasonably easy to get up and running with the clinicalfutures.org.uk and cossac.org sites and was able to produce something quickly. Furthermore I was able to add functionality as and when it was required. Most recently I’ve added forums and email notifications to the cossac web site.

Comparing Content Management Systems

The CMS market is now extremely crowded. The cmsmatrix website attempts to compare a great deal of them. If you compare, say drupal, modx, joomla and wordpress (all open source cms systems) – you’ll see that what they have in common is more pronounced than what separates them. One thing I take away from this comparison is that modx doesnt have as much “off the shelf plugins” than the others do, but that may be because modx allows you to build these things for yourself more easily – I dont know it well enough.

How to decide

IMO the question as to which CMS to use boils down to two issues:

 1. which satisfies the needs of the content generators and site managers  
 2. which can be supported by new people / external organisations

I cant actually answer question 1 properly because I dont know modx well enough. As I’ve indicated above I believe modx outperforms drupal from the content generator’s perspective, but at what cost to the site managers? – this I dont know. For question 2 I believe that drupal wins easily over modx because I believe it is much more widely used and I see lots of web shops supporting it. If you google for “modx experts” you’ll see all adverts on the right hand side are for drupal, joomla and wordpress expertise.
