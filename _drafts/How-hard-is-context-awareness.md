A consideration of how hard it is to adjust the headings in a list of updates, based on other members of tha same list. e.g. if more than one update occurred in a day, then you might want to show the times, but otherwise the day would suffice.

And then a generalisation to all software applications, a description of the frame problem, a reference to robotics perhaps and some closing questions with regards to understanding the hardness of this problem.
