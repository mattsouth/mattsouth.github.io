So this is a completely unresearched, off-topic entry that I probably wonâ€™t publish, but I just wanted to get down.

Why is it that two people attract?

Is it timing? Are we more susceptible to approaches at different times.

What is that makes that other person seem particularly interesting?

How much of this is learnt and how much is instinct.
