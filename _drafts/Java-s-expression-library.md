I had a need for a Java s-expression library recently and couldn’t find one – at least not a pure Java one. The nearest I could get was a [blog entry](http://jfkbits.blogspot.com/2008/05/thoughts-on-s-expression-parser.html) linked from google but the post only outlines a partial solution to the crux of an elegant parser and needed some extra grunt work to make into something usable.

So in case it’s useful, and with the blessing of the original blog entry author (thanks Joel), I’ve added the jar as a download from this page.

TODO: more about how to use it and what you get out of it.
