vue 3 [was released](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-as-the-new-default.html) in early 2022 and vue 2 is scheduled for end of life in December 2023. Im in the process of transitioning from vue-2 to vue-3 for my main project. This post outlines a couple of the issues that Ive noticed in the meteor integration that Im not seeing talked about, particularly in the updates to meteor-vue-tracker for vue-3 that can also be used, with some changes in existing vue-2 single file components.
