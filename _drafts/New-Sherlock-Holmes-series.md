First episode. Of course it was a cabbie. And it was signalled too early and too blatantly.

Like the relationship – difficult, ambiguous and absolutely about the work.  
Love the holmesian analysis in a modern setting (always the best bit).  
Not happy about the dramatic element of the criminal conspiracy around his website, but maybe that has legs.  
The criminal conspiracy and reach of Mycroft just doesnt work.  
Psycopath / high functioning sociopath angle is interesting.

Last shot implied that they were walking off into the distance with explosions behind them (at least to me). Really annoyed me at first, but grew on me – fits nicely with the Mycroft dialogue earlier.

Course I have a deep seated affection for the original

What does the new interpretation have to say about modern Britains attitude to victorian heroes and society? How much is there a deliberate juxtaposition?
