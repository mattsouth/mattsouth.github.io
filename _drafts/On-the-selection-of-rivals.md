Something that I’ve been pondering recently in my typically lightweight fashion is the importance of rivals.

reference to my first experience of sales – dr jones down the road.

rivalry is everywhere at work and can be healthy, but it a lot of cases recently has not.

reference the article on getting angry at work

John’s use of rivals

Fred the Shred’s probable motivation in keeping his bonus – rivalry with other bank heads

Q how are rivals selected – is there an analogy to socials networks?

a characterisation of the sense of entitlement in the business community based on rivalry

How software salesmen use rivalry

conclusion – rivalry is an important motivator, and one that you should be aware in other people and yourself – it will help you understand the world better.
