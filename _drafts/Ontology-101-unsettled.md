Interesting quote from wired magazine Oct an article entitle “Barcode of Life”

> The Linnean hierarchy is an out-moded remnant of a pre-evolutionary world-view,

Mischler says.

> People want to think of things as members of mutually exclusive hierarchically organized categories. It is probably hard-wired into human beings, but it is not true, and it is the source of tremendous problems in the world.
