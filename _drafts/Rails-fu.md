I finally got around to trying a Rails development project. I found this particular [getting started article](http://www.jonathansng.com/ruby-on-rails/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-now-with-more-202/) the most useful. I was able to get my toy ideas enacted as dynamic web pages in a couple of hours. sweeeet.
