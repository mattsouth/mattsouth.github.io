If you have a lot of lego blocks then sorting them can be an enormous pain. A cool project would be to build a tool that allowed you to do this automatically. There are some mindstorms projects that allow you to do this by pouring a limited set of blocks into a hopper that feeds the blocks onto a conveyor which then sorts them into different pots, usually based on colour. This is a start but seems very limited. I imagine one ought to be able to build some kind of robot vehicle that, given enough space on a smooth floor separate a large pile of lego bricks into smaller piles of equivalent blocks. For a big pile, this would take some time but overnight the job ought to be achievable.

It’s not obvious to me how to achieve this goal, but it seems to me that one ought to be able to do the following things:

separate a heaped pile into a flat pile of separated bricks

distinguish different types of bricks

move an individual brick from a flat pile into a are on it’s own
