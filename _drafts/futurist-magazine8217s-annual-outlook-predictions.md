[Futurist magazine’s annual outlook 2008](http://www.wfs.org/Nov-Dec%20Files/TOPTEN.htm) predictions caught my eye, especially the last one:

 **<span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;">10. More decisions will be made by nonhuman entities.</span>**<span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;"> Electronically enabled teams in networks, robots with artificial intelligence, and other noncarbon life-forms will make financial, health, educational, and even political decisions for us. Reason: Technologies are increasing the complexity of our lives and human workers’ competency is not keeping pace well enough to avoid disasters due to human error. —*Arnold Brown, “‘Not with a Bang’: Civilization’s Accelerating Challenge,” Sep-Oct 2007, p. 38*</span>

I work within an academic robotics research group that focusses on clinical decision making, so it’s not surprising that this would catch my eye. I work there for many reasons. The historical reasons involve some career planning and some “being in the right place at the right time”. The main contemporary reason I do this work is that it fulfils my work goals on many axes. But in an R&amp;D role there is always the possibility that you are running in the wrong direction, so it’s always nice to find external support for your personal decisions.
