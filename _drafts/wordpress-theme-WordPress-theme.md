[![](http://www.styleshout.com/templates/thumbnails/Envision.jpg)](http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/Envision1-0/index.html)I fell in love with this [styleshout](http://www.styleshout.com) web template and decided to hack it into a WordPress theme. Someone else had done it before, but their license was a little too restrictive for my liking. It took a few hours but was well worth it. Itâ€™s not widget friendly yet, but it will do for now.

This was almost my first encounter with PHP and definately my first encounter with the WordPress codebase but the task turned out to be fairly straightforward. The files in the WordPress themes were intuitively named and the code was easy to read. The only problem I had was tracing the location of some of the core functions that are used in the theme, but this is quite normal for this sort of application I feel.
