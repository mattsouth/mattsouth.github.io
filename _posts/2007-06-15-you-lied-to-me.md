A Dutch colleague introduced me to [plasmasturm.org](http://plasmasturm.org/) a while ago – an excellent software engineering resource. I hadnt noticed it before\* but today I was most tickled by a quote he has on his code page:

<cite>A friend of mine in a compiler writing class produced a compiler with one error message ‘you lied to me when you told me this was a program’</cite>

see [plasmasturm.org/code.](http://plasmasturm.org/code/)

\* Maybe I did notice it before and didnt get it. Since I first looked at that site I’ve done some work with the [RACC](http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/racc/), [JACC](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/jacc/index.html) and [JavaCC](https://javacc.dev.java.net/) compiler compilers (of the two Java compiler compilers, I prefer JavaCC).
