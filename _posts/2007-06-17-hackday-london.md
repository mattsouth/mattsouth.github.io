Its the end of the [Yahoo/BBC hackday](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6757361.stm) weekend. The atmosphere at the beginning of the first day was really good and the weekend looked promising. But I left that day early and frustrated. I wanted to try out some of the cool tools being talked about but I couldnt get started because the network was too unreliable. It was a shame. I did meet some interesting people and I saw a great talk on machine tags by [Aaron Straup Cope](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog) and [Dan Catt](http://www.flickr.com/people/revdancatt) though. I hope they got the network stabilised later on for the die hards and Iâ€™m intrigued to find out more about the final submitted hacks. It was always going to be difficult for me to attend the second day, due to family commitments, and I suppose this means I didnt fully prepare or get into the spirit of things. Looking at the blogs, the vast majority of the attendees got a lot out of it, and only a few lightweights who left early, like me, felt let down. If there is a next time I will both prepare more in advance and ensure I can attend the whole event. Oh, and come with a 3G card in my back pocket.
