[![Sweeney Todd mind map](http://halfdecent.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/sweeney-todd-mind-map.png)](http://www.wikimindmap.org/viewmap.php?wiki=en.wikipedia.org&topic=Sweeney+Todd&Submit=Search "Sweeney Todd mind map")

On Friday the excellent [information aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/) feed pointed me to [wikimindmap.org](http://wikimindmap.org), an [Adobe Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/) visualisation of a [wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) topic as a mind map. The image above shows the wikimindmap visualization for Sweeney Todd – the main character in the musical/opera of the same name by Steven Sondheim (chosen for it’s compact size, and because I’ve just been to see it performed at the Royal Festival Hall). This is very nice. It combines the “at a glance” loveliness of [mind mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping) with the collective wisdom of wikipedia. It may provide a way for humans (as opposed to machines – that is another story) to scan topics more quickly than scan-reading them.
