[Cargo cults](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) are a delightful new concept to me, from the excellent and thought provoking blog entry, [internal code re-use considered dangerous](http://www.yafla.com/dforbes/2005/09/15.html#a54), which in turn was a link from another blog entry, [is your code worthless?](http://cysquatch.net/blog/?p=43) which in turn was a link from [theserverside.com](http://theserverside.com). Now thatâ€™s provenance baby. Too much information?
