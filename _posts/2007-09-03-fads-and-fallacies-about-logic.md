In the last two years I have come across several long articles by John Sowa. What Iâ€™ve read of them has been of very high quality, but towards the edge of my radar. Thus they are still in my in-pile. Today I came across a short, recent article that is a pure gold antidote to some of the extremely drawn out and ongoing discussions in the semantic web communities: [Fads and Fallacies about logic](http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/fflogic.pdf).
