Imagine a pill that signals when it’s been swallowed, allowing a patient to track their adherence to the drug’s regime and, if combined with other sensors, the impact of the treatment (thus allowing them to customise the regime in an informed manner). Well [someone’s built one](http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/20434/). Very sci fi.
