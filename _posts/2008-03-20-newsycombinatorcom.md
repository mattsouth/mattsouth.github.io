I recently discovered [news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com) and I’m loving it. It’s another social link aggregator like [digg](http://www.digg.com) or [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), but I find the quality of the links excellent. I have space in my schedule for about two good, longish articles a day, and this site is producing more than I can handle. An embarrassment of riches. Examples from a day earlier this week include:

- [Big dog video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1czBcnX1Ww) – impressive, very expensive looking robotic quadruped from DARPA
- [Blowing up](http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_04_29_a_blowingup.htm) – a 2002 article from New York Times focussing on Nassim Nicholas Taleb – a hedge fund investor looking for black swans.
- [Shell shock](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/eureka-march-0311.html) – a write up of a researcher at MIT interested in biologically inspired self-assembling materials.
