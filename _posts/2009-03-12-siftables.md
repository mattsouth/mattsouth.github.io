Came across [siftables](http://siftables.com/) today for the first time [via a link from O’Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/four-short-links-11-mar-2009.html), which referenced a post from that [very nice Phil chap’s](http://www.gyford.com/) [coverage at ETech](http://www.overmorgen.com/weblog/2009/03/12/siftables.ph) (wish I was there). This is very nice kit. The video on the siftables site is really quite exciting. And it shows footage from a media lab – another awesome project from MIT that I’d forgotten about. All very life affirming.

Apparently there was a New Scientist article about it a month or so ago so I was surprised I’d missed it. I suppose it must have been in that issue that got lost in the heavy snow 🙁
