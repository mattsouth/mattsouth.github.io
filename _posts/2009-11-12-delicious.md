I’ve been using the online favourites repository service, [delicious](http://delicious.com) for a few years now and it’s something I really like. I add a link several times a week these days, much more so than I update my blog – so I’ve added an “Interesting…” widget on the right.

When I save a link to delicious I have two rules that I’m not always able to keep:

1. Always write a description and
2. Never use the word “interesting”.
