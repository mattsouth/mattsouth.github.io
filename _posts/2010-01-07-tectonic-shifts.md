I’m absolutely gobsmacked by the[ list of datasets](http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/data-packages-launch) that the City of London has [declared it will publish today](http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=24640). This is a huge democratising step that I am very impressed by. I dont know the back story – in my experience this sort of thing takes years to happen – but I’m sure the City of London will be immediately rewarded with innovative visualisations of their data because there are lots of motivated and very capable people in that city. Exciting stuff.
