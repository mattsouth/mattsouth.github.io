I needed latex this morning. My quick tip for installing it on Ubuntu Karmic Koala is to install Texmaker via the “Ubuntu Software Centre” (which you should be able to find at the bottom of the Applications menu) and then install the

- texlive-fonts-recommended
- texlive-fonts-extra

packages on the command line with aptitude. This sorted me out very quickly, and the interface for the new texmaker version in karmic seems excellent – attractive and intuitive.
