![](http://blog.mattsouth.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/woodentrack-bend.png)Last year in a slow period I knocked up a[ javascript library for making wooden toy train designs](http://www.github.com/mattsouth/woodentrack) as a useful/interesting exercise. After getting some implicit feedback on it last week (somewhat baffled), I decided to review it, give it a spruce up and add some more explanation. It’s still barely a proof of concept but you can see the results [here](http://mattsouth.github.io/woodentrack/demo.html).

The next pieces of work (should I get the chance) will probably focus on:

1. finessing the API, i.e. “Create a track at the browser command prompt, attach a track painter and watch the drawn track change as you add/remove pieces and edit the track properties” and
2. adding annotations to the free ends of track drawn in the DSL demo so it’s clear how to add more track to them.
