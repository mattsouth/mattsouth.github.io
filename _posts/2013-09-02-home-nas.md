So I’m looking at acquiring some network attached storage (NAS) and wondering how best to get a cute, quiet, efficient box that will store and share the family pictures / emails / music / files (not videos) within a mixed environment (Windows, Ubuntu, Android, Smart TV) and not be a burden to maintain. Software-wise I like Ubuntu (for the OS) and Subsonic (for the music streaming) but I’m not especially attached to either. [This home built server matches these “requirements”](http://www.danielandrade.net/2011/08/29/diy-home-ubuntu-nas-server/) but the diy angle is a little too onerous for me right now.

[Linus Torvalds](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LinusTorvalds/posts/REfnCV1y8Dy) went through a similar process earlier this year and has some nice suggestions in the comments on his google+ thread. In particular people seem to like the drobo, qnap, synology offerings but most vendors get a mention. After this first pass I’m quite taken with the [Synology DS213+](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Synology-DS213-DiskStation-Diskless-Performance/dp/B0091MHMZ4) as it’s linux, it seems to do all I require and people are almost raving about it in the comments, but I’ll look into the options a little deeper before jumping in…

\[Edit – [seems Linus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LinusTorvalds/posts/hvnMn1fFKEm) came to the same conclusion re: vendor after his post\]
