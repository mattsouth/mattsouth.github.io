[![](http://blog.mattsouth.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot_1506117569.png?w=180)](http://halfdecent.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_1506117569.png)My family spent a week in Finland this summer as part of our summer holiday. One of the many highlights was a visit to the design museum in Helsinki which is excellent and well worth a visit if you go there. The ground floor was dedicated to the work of Margrethe Odgaard, an artist/artisan from Copenhagen who has an exquisite eye for colour, particularly, but not exclusively, in textiles. One of the things presented were [colour diaries ](https://vimeo.com/205349549)that she’d kept on visits to Morocco and Cuba that were fascinating and beautiful. It gave me an idea for a simple phone app that I could build that would allow me to do the same thing, so I created it using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). If you have an android phone, you can download it for yourself from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.mattsouth.colourdiary). It’s in beta because Ive not done this before and at the moment I only know that it works on my phone. I’d love to hear any feedback you might have.
